# StudiGO

This repository serves as the personal code-base for my individual project "StudiGO".

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, ensure that you have the following software and tools installed:
- IDE with support for .NET (Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider)

## Repository usage
This repository is organized to manage the project efficiently. To ensure a structured and organized workflow, I will follow these practices:

### Branch Management
- **main:** The main branch is the stable production branch. It should always contain the latest stable and deployable version of your code. Direct commits to main should be avoided.
- **chore/:** Create chore branches for non-feature tasks such as maintenance, code refactoring, or other housekeeping activities. 
- **feature/:** Create feature branches when working on new functionality or enhancements.
- **bug/:** Create bug branches when working on a fix for a specific bug.

### Commit Message Prefixes
- **feat:** Adding a new feature.
- **chore:** Writing documentation, formatting, adding tests, refactoring etc.
- **fix:** Bug fixes.

## Contributing
As this is a individual project, this will be managed by myself alone.
